            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>Profuga 2012 - grade 10, first year competing. primative robot, minimal kiosk no website submitted, no journalism done, video homade corney. Results: finished 17th overall, 7th for the robot game in semi-finals, 12th for robot design 20th in kiosk. 24 teams competed</p>
            <p>Velostics 2013 - grade 11, second year participating. our moto: "Go big or go Home". found out the hard way about beauracracy. Attempted to Quit the team , lasted for 3 days. Full out kiosk poorly painted, built robot at the competition, video, website, journalism, submitted late. Results: kiosk was 12th, game was 26th (of 27), robot was 24th, website video and journalism were 19th. Utter worst expereince of my life</p>
            <p>Actimania 2015 - college year two, did what needed to get done. I kew what i was getting myself into and this time i had a diverse team of people who I could rely on to get tasks done.</p>
            
            <h4>The full story</h4>
            <p>How it all started... Highschool grade 10/secondary 4 ... EST Science with Mr Mallalieu, one of the best teachers I have the chance to learn from, had decided to get the school involved in a robotics competition he saw the year before on the news. The competition was held by <a href="http://www.robo-crc.ca/en/">CRC Robotics</a> and called Profuga 2012. At forat the Robotics team was made of the graduating years nerds who were took over the program; with the interest of having the program last the teachers decided a better plan was to get my grade invovled soo there would be a year of learnging followed by a year of transition of our experiences to the lower grades. My science teacher encourage myself and two friends to join in addition to a fellow peer of ours. So a month in and a quater of a robot built with never seeing the game or getting an explination we got to work. What we were given from the CRC as a part of the entrence kit was a VEX robotics kit and 5 motors. The older kids left of drawings of the game feild and notes they took, so ke knew the playing feild had a large ramp in the middle and we had to get over it.</p>
            <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/robo_2012_highlightvideo.png" alt="christopher mcarthur chris mcarthur montreal concordia - screenshot of the robot from the highlight video on youtube posted by the CRC"/></span>So we set out to beuind the best robot that would be there! we know knowing of how to wire the motors so those when back into the parts bin. The vext was easy to work with, so we took the two longest peices the two second logest peices and made a retagular frame. Coming back from Christmas break we put the motors and wheels close to the edges so it would get over the ramp. Next thing we noticed we had 4 days for the deadline to present a video, website and journalize in both french and english; the video got done, a  cheap home video production filmed with my friends iPhone we were Indiana Jones stealing foam cudes and placing triangles on totems running from a robot (that was pulled by a rope). Went went back to the robot after goofing off for a few days and put the interface on the robot with the rest of the electronics. The very first time i saw code was watch my peer who had experience with C making our robot come to life. With two days left to spare we started to build our epic kiosk. We went with a news themed back ground with fancy 8x11 printed blocks about the school and other requested information. the kiosk was a banner frame made from 3 2x4s our teacher got us which we painted black with old paint.</p>
            <p>The day of the competition, it was held at Vanier College this year so we loaded eveything into my teammate's father's pick up truck and arrived at our staging time. </p>
