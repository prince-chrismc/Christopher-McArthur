                    <h4> It all started with a long bus and metro ride being stuck in traffic...</h4>
                    <blockquote>"hey, I wonder if I can make a website."</blockquote> 
                    <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Site_one.png" alt="" /><img src="images/Site_two.png" alt="" /><img src="images/Site_three.png" alt="" /></span>So a quick Google and a stop to <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/">W3School HTML</a> and I was off. <code>cout >> "This is my First Webpage";</code> Thats where my problem started! As an artistic person with an OCD nature for visually appleasing sights, I couldnt not leave it as a black and white... soo i moved to a CSS tutorial and began looking at website i thought looked nice and checked out what they had behind the sense. Next version was nicer with a menu but my stylesheet was in my html doc.</p>
                    <p>I learn best by example. Watching my dad doing oil changes, changing tires, brakes, etc; at work to learn internal systems and procedures. The same held for this website, after looking at tutorials and trying to develope an understanding of css I came across <a href="templated.co">TEMPLATED</a> where I came across a theme which suited my needs quiet well. Building from this I disected the code, changed elements to reflect myself; Through this I was Finally able to understand enough to rebuildand strip the site down to its components and build it the way i like it from the ground up. Hoping that whoing off my website will get me the change to rebuild a notary's website (family connection) so I can gain some relevent work experience!</p>
                    <pre>Random code!<code>i = 0;<br><br>while (!deck.isInOrder())<br>{<br>     print 'Iteration ' + i;<br>     deck.shuffle();<br>     i++;<br>}<br>print 'It took ' + i + ' iterations to sort the deck.';</code></pre>
                    <p>about to update my git for pretty much everything, may 30th 11pm, before bed and i just wanted to write a blurb as a summation of what ive done lately. Across all the pages, the menu nav got an update it went from black to the teal i have on my buttons and i added fontawesome icons to the list, just out my personal pages and added my github and linkedin to it(run on sentence). index page is untouch fixed a few typos but i know there's more proof reading will come later. main css, cutting out the slides show i tried to make and replaced it with a skrollr page, its only 4 pictures one being a download but i got the works and im quiet impressed with myself i must admit. off my skrollr addition i made a consturction page, some of my links have been broken up to this point and that was very unprofessional so i makde a costume slides for that, it will be finished in the coming days as i havent added my helper to let it work. lastly for html page updates this one got bootstrap for the resizing help, did a lot manually but it wasnt perfect, there was lots of formatting isues soo it will be hard to put it across all pages. oh yes my php work has began! but its off to a slow start ive been playing with it on my portfolio page as well as string to do the submit button on index- its falling behind because i havent finished content which is never ending since i keep coming up with new ideas. Stay tuned for more updates! Oh i forgot also i need to add all my c++/OOP/.net work to github</p>
